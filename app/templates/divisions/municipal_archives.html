        <p>The Municipal Archives (MA) preserves and makes available the
            historical records of New York City government. The MA holds over 200,000 cubic feet and over 50TB of
            records dating from the early seventeenth century to the present. Acquired from more than one hundred City
            agencies, the collections comprise office records, manuscript material, still and moving images, ledger
            volumes, vital records, maps, blueprints, objects, sound recordings, and digital files.
            <br><br>
            The MA is an active information center. Our collections are dynamic, and we are in the midst of implementing
            unparalleled digital access to the municipal collections.
            <br><br>
            The collections are used by City agencies and the public (even international audiences). The collections
            support agency anniversary planning, strategic planning, employee training, and marketing; and the
            international public with genealogical, political, economic, and social histories of New York.
            <br><br>
            As the Cityâ€™s central archival repository, the MA operates two climate-controlled records storage
            facilities.
            <br><br>
            The Appraisals and Accessions Unit works with RM to transfer records with historical value to the Archives.
            Once they arrive, either in boxes or on drives, the team verifies the contents, identifies the organization,
            and conducts a series of tasks to formally transfer the custody of the records to the Archives.
            <br><br>
            A Collections Management Unit manages the physical and intellectual control of records. That includes
            creating guides for the public to use when they are researching our collections, ensuring we have accurate
            data on the size, formats, and conditions of our collections, and works to further access to our collections
            through archival tools.
            <br><br>
            Conservators at the MA physically repair and/or restore collections at an item level. The MA conservation
            lab enables professionals to perform assessments and apply various techniques to stabilize objects, apply
            corrective treatments, and manage long term physical and environmental conditions ensuring preventive
            conservation efforts in terms of house-keeping, controlling and documenting temperature and humidity,
            integrated pest management, and creating archival enclosures to reduce damage and deterioration of records.
            <br><br>
            Digital Programs Unit manages strategic digital environments for the Municipal Library and Archives
            divisions. In addition, the digital lab provides state-of-the-art digitization services while ensuring
            industry standard best practices in description, preservation, and access of historical records.
