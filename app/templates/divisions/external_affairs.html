        <p>The Community and External Affairs Unit coordinates the public-facing
            elements of the agency, including its websites, social media, public programs, education, community outreach
            and marketing. The Unit advances the Department of Records and Information Services’ agenda by developing
            external relationships, managing strategic implementation of projects and building community support. It is
            responsible for attracting, welcoming, and retaining visitors to DORIS’ public-facing forums both online and
            on premises and for managing staff engagement. Using outreach to the media, the public, the city's many
            communities, and government offices and officials at all levels, the unit endeavors to reach ever-expanding
            audiences.
