        <p>The Municipal Library is mandated by the New York City Charter as the
            official repository for New York City agency publications. With access through our print collection and
            electronic government documents portal, the Library provides a unique set of resources on the history of New
            York City. Library staff assist researchers with reference requests, catalog print and electronic materials
            and reach out to city agencies to ensure that they comply with the Charter mandate. Increasingly the Library
            will be digitizing the collection to expand our user base. Also, of interest to DORIS employees, we maintain
            a collection of civil service examinations and study guides for various job titles. Although the exams are
            only current through the 1980â€™s, they may be of use and study guides might also be available.
