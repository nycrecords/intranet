                side of the keyboard above the number 7. While tapping the Num Lock key, notice whether or not the Num
                Lock light goes on and off. If it doesn't, the computer is completely locked up. You’ll have to REBOOT
                the computer. If the light does go off and on, then wait a minute before giving up hope. It might come
                back to life on its own.

                Pressing Alt + F4 keys - If a software program stops working or freezes up, try pressing the ALT+F4 keys
                to close the window that you’re currently working in. This can shut down a frozen window and bring the
                computer back to life.

                If it doesn't work on the other computer, there is likely something wrong with the keyboard. If it does

            <p class="common-question-answer-text">When you press the CTRL-ALT-DEL buttons together, it will bring up
                a control panel where you can select “Task Manager” and see if any of the programs are shown as “not
                responding”. You may be able to shut down the offending program from there.

            <h1 class="common-question-answer-header">Should I reboot my computer?</h1>
            <p class="common-question-answer-text">Rebooting can do wonders. Don’t just pull the plug!
                <br>
                <br>
                A simple reboot may clear up the problem. Go to the Start Menu and select Shutdown. Didn't work? It's
                time to try a forced reboot — with, unfortunately, no way to save your work — by pressing the keys
                CTRL-ALT-DEL simultaneously twice in a row.
                <br>
                <br>
                If that didn't work, you have no choice: you have to turn the computer off manually with the power
                switch. Hold the power button down (for about 5 -10 seconds) and the computer will shut down. Wait at
                least 10 seconds for the hard drive to stop spinning and then restart the machine.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the computer starts up, start the applications you were using when the crash occurred. Some programs,
                like Microsoft Word, make timed backups of your work and may bring up recovered files. If the program
                notifies you that there is a “recovered document” save the file under a different name and compare them
                to your previously saved files.</p>

            <p class="common-question-answer-text">DoITT has provided the following information regarding accessing
                Enterprise Vault and archiving in Office 365:</p>
            <p class="common-question-answer-text">Background: Before the migration to Office 365, the archival platform
                for emails has been the Enterprise Vault (EV), an on-premises solution hosted at DoITT. After DoITT
                migrated all Mailboxes to the cloud (Office 365) then the archiving platform also moved to the cloud.
                DoITT is working on a project to migrate the legacy data from on-premises Enterprise Vault to Office
                365. We do not have a date as to when that project will be completed. However, the following information
                will help you regarding the archival process.</p>
            <p class="common-question-answer-text">How do I access archival items through Enterprise Vault?</p>
            <p class="common-question-answer-text">To access your EV archival items please follow the links below. I
                recommend that you bookmark these links:</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="common-question-answer-text">What is the archiving process in the cloud (Office 365)?</p>
            <p class="common-question-answer-text">The archiving is done after 1 year in the cloud (Office 365) since
                the primary mailbox limit is 100 GB per mailbox and the archiving is unlimited. This eliminates the
                on-premises archiving policy as the storage is not an issue anymore. DORIS migrated to Office 365 as of
                February 26th, 2020. So, the archiving began after that date in the year 2021 for us.</p>
